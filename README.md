# 🛡️ Crisis Management AI Assistant

An AI-powered assistant for emergency and crisis management using advanced NLP and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques.

## 📌 Description

It uses LangChain + NVIDIA Embeddings to provide intelligent responses based on real emergency documents.

The assistant is capable of:

- Reading emergency protocols from local documents
- Understanding natural language queries
- Responding with helpful actions using a chatbot interface

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- LangChain
- FAISS
- NVIDIA NIM Embeddings

- Flask *(optional for deployment)*

## 📁 Project Files

- `crisis_assistant.ipynb`: main Colab notebook with all code
- `data/`: folder with emergency-related files
- `README.md`: this file

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Deploying as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
- Integrating with Telegram for real-time crisis response
- Adding voice command support
